# Part II Physics Computational Project - Hierarchical Methods for N-Body Simulation
This repository contains the code I produced for my Part II Computational Physics Project at the University of Cambridge.
## Overview
- Analytic, Direct Evaluation, Barnes-Hut and Fast Multipole methods of N-body simulation are implemented as classes within the [modules](https://github.com/THartigan/Computing_Project/tree/main/modules) folder.
- The behaviour of these models are then explored in the Jupyter notebooks indexed 0-1.
- Complexity analysis is also conducted "complexity_" notebooks.
